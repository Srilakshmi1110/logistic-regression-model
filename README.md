# logistic-regression-model
This project uses Logistic Regression to predict user clicks on online ads. 
It solves ConnectSphere Digital's problem of inefficient ad targeting and budget waste. Data preprocessing, feature scaling, and train-test splitting prepare the dataset for modeling. 
The model is trained and evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve. '
This model optimizes ad spend, improves click-through rates, and boosts campaign performance.
It offers insights into user behavior and helps allocate marketing resources better.
This approach helps optimize ad spend by focusing on users more likely to click, increasing the click-through rate and improving campaign performance.
