This project uses Logistic Regression to predict user clicks on online ads. It solves ConnectSphere Digital's problem of inefficient ad targeting and budget waste. Data preprocessing, feature scaling, and train-test splitting prepare the dataset for modeling.  The model is trained and evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curve.
